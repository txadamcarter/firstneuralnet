# firstneuralnet

This is the very first neural network I ever wrote. It is taken from Tariq Rashid's excellent book "Make Your Own Neural Network" subtitled "A gentle journey through the mathematics of neural networks, and making your own using the Python computer language".

Using a rather shallow network by most standards, I was able to successfully classify digits from the MNIST dataset with a respectably low error rate. The network is implemented completely in python using numpy.
